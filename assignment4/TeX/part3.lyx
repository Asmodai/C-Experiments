\begin_layout Chapter
Commodore Disk Loading Problems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Brand of disk drive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At present, our C64 product line only supports Commodore disk drives (i.e.
 1541 & 1571).
 We cannot guarantee compatibility with other brands.
 We have a built-in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fast loader
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that can load programs over 10 times faster than a normal 1541 load.
 This requires the internals of the disk drive to be very close to what
 a Commodore disk drive looks like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Random boot problems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have found that a variety of problems can be caused by equipment being
 attached to your C64.
 We therefore recommend that all peripherals and cartridges (particularly
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fast loaders
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) be removed from your C64 computer prior to running any of our games.
 People are surprised to find out that just turning the power off to these
 devices is not enough.
 Our software utilizes all 64K of RAM in the system and uses memory configuratio
ns that differ from other game software.
 This tends to upset modems and printers and the like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Drive alignment problems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have found that our original 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fast loader
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 required 1541 and 1571 disk drive alignment to be in close adjustment.
 A weakness in Commodore's 1541 disk drive design (along with the fact that
 other companies' older protection schemes involved the stepper motor banging
 itself against the track zero stop) causes many disk drives to become out
 of alignment.
 Both Commodore and other companies have wised up, but it still leaves a
 lot of disk drives partially out of alignment.
 We have therefore improved our 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fast loader
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 software to be more forgiving.
 Of course, the best long-term solution is to get your disk drive aligned.

\begin_layout Standard

 less than 256K.

The DOS version of

 was designed to allow you to use a word file on another disk.
 If you do not have two disk drives in your IBM PC/PCjr or clone, then you
 will need to have a second disk ready to use once the system prompts you
 to insert it.
 This disk will contain the word file as indicated by the command you type
 to start the game.

 at least 16 colours).
 It will still work on a monochrome display, but it will not look as good.

 is based on the pencil and paper version of Hangman and, although it does
 depict capital punishment and the taking of a life, it does so in a non-violent
 and non-graphic manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Do you have a port for my machine?

s from Sun Microsystems, the VAX-11 minicomputers from Digital Equipment
 Corporation, and the Apollo Domain workstations.

\begin_layout Section*
It's spelled `color', not `colour', what is wrong with you people?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We're British, thus this manual uses British spellings of words, ergo it's
 spelt `colour'.
