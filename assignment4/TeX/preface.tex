This document is the manual for my submission for assignment 4 of
Dr Mike Evans' C++ course. It is written in the style of a game manual
produced in the 1980s for the early IBM PC and PC clone market, and
tries not to take itself too seriously. Writing the code for this
assignment was a lot of fun, mostly due to the fact that I have not
used a text user interface toolkit since the days of Borland's \emph{Turbo
C++} product and I hope you enjoy playing this game as much as I did
writing it.
